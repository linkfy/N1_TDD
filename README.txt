Next Steps:

Goal:
Prioritize a working main.py/manual execution path for Mapper000/NROM ROMs while
preserving the linear pytest tutorial flow and avoiding later refactors.

Immediate direction:
	Manual ROM execution now reaches visible background output and keyboard input.
	The next major missing visual system is sprite rendering. OAMDMA already copies
	sprite bytes into PPU.oam, so Chapter 09 can build rendering on top of real OAM
	data rather than fake sprite fixtures in main.py.

	Do not prioritize opcode diagnostics right now. Keep that as a future debugging
	improvement after the bus-visible startup behavior is less crash-prone.

Working main.py means:
	- a developer can provide a local .nes file path manually
	- the emulator boots from the ROM reset vector
	- Console can step frame-by-frame
	- unsupported I/O does not crash when the missing system is intentionally out of scope
	- tests remain synthetic and do not require commercial ROM files

Manual core validator command:
	uv run python core_validator.py

Expected behavior:
	core_validator.py is a long-running manual ROM execution tool. It will keep
	stepping frames and will not exit by itself. Press Ctrl+C to stop it. This is
	expected and should not be treated as a hang if frame/debug output keeps moving.

Local ROM policy for manual main.py runs:
	- The tutorial repository does not include commercial ROM files.
	- If a student/developer wants to manually try Mario Bros., they must provide
	  their own legal copy as:
		MarioBros.nes
	- This file is intentionally ignored by git.
	- Any Mario Bros. `.nes` file that uses Mapper000/NROM should exercise the same
	  mapper path, though exact ROM hashes may differ between dumps/revisions.
	- To record the local file hash, run:
		md5sum MarioBros.nes
	- Reference local MarioBros.nes MD5 used during tutorial development:
		5d7bcc400a2fb5fa27346da345d3bb62  MarioBros.nes
	  This is only a reference for manual experiments. Users must provide their own
	  legal copy, and hashes may differ between dumps/revisions.

Important rule:
Do not implement sprite 0 hit or sprite overflow yet. Those require rendering,
sprite evaluation, OAM timing, and pixel overlap behavior.

Stubbing policy:
Avoid broad fake stubs for systems that are part of the tutorial path.
PPU behavior should be implemented intentionally, not faked.
Audio/APU can be stubbed later because audio is out of tutorial scope.

For main.py survival:
	- APU/audio register writes may become explicit no-ops because audio is out of scope.
	- Controller $4016 should be implemented intentionally, not faked.
	- OAMDMA $4014 should be implemented intentionally, even before sprite rendering.
	- Avoid broad catch-all CpuBus handlers that hide real unsupported addresses.

Compatibility rule:
Old tutorial steps may document the implementation shape they introduced.
For example, the original PpuBus VRAM test may mention direct vram access because
that step teaches the first simple backing store.

From the current PPU memory-map refinement onward, new tests should prefer public
PpuBus behavior via:
	ppu_bus.read(addr)
	ppu_bus.write(addr, value)

Avoid new tests depending on:
	ppu_bus.vram.read(addr)
	ppu_bus.vram.write(addr, value)

unless the test is intentionally about the low-level VRAM memory device or an old
historical teaching step.

Rendering policy:
	Do not add image-output/debug-image generation now.
	Pygame is allowed only in manual/frontend entry points such as tools/ or main.py.
	The emulator core continues to produce pure Framebuffer data.

Pygame/testing policy for Phase 7:
	Keep pygame outside the emulator core.
	The emulator core should produce pure framebuffer data.
	Pygame should only appear in manual/frontend entry points such as tools/ or main.py.

	Tests should focus on pure data transformations, for example:
		color-index grid -> RGB/framebuffer data
		pattern table grid -> framebuffer data
		nametable data -> framebuffer data

	Avoid tests that depend on a real pygame window.
	Manual pygame smoke runners are acceptable for visual confirmation.

	Preferred boundary:
		emulator/ppu or emulator/rendering:
			pure rendering/framebuffer functions

		emulator/frontend or tools:
			pygame window, event loop, keyboard, display upload

	The emulator core should still be importable/testable without pygame.

Controller policy:
	Basic VBlank/NMI progression and frame stepping now exist.
	Controller $4016 can be prioritized soon because local ROM experiments already
	reach controller-addressing paths.
	Implement the real strobe/latch/shift behavior rather than fake button reads.
	Controller tests should start in chapter 07 after the chapter 06 ROM startup
	preparation tests.

Sprite policy:
	Start with data decoding before drawing.
	OAMDMA remains CPU-bus behavior; sprite rendering reads PPU.oam.
	Do not implement sprite 0 hit or sprite overflow yet.
	Do not make pygame part of sprite rendering. Sprite rendering should produce pure
	Framebuffer data, and main.py should only display that data.


Next tutorial step:

Step 298) Decode one OAM sprite entry
	Files:
		emulator/rendering/sprite_renderer.py or emulator/ppu/sprite.py
		tests/chapter_09_sprite_rendering/test_298_sprite_entry_decode.py

	Behavior:
		Read four bytes from PPU OAM for one sprite index and expose them as a small
		SpriteEntry data object: y, tile_index, attributes, x.

	Goal:
		create a stable, testable sprite data model before adding sprite pixels to the
		framebuffer.

	Existing reset-vector evidence:
		CPU.reset() already exists in emulator/cpu/cpu.py.
		Reset vector behavior is covered by:
			tests/chapter_01_cpu/test_008_cpu_reset_vector.py
		Cartridge/Mapper000 reset-vector boot is already validated by:
			tests/chapter_02_rom_loading/test_223_VALIDATION_cpu_executes_tiny_ines_rom.py

	Important:
		Do not commit MarioBros.nes or any commercial ROM fixture.
		Use synthetic OAM bytes in automated tests.
		Do not render sprites in this first sprite step.
		Do not implement sprite 0 hit or sprite overflow yet.
		Pygame must stay outside emulator core rendering modules.

	After this:
		Step 299) Decode sprite attributes: palette ID, priority, horizontal flip,
		          vertical flip.
		Step 300) Build sprite palettes from PPU palette RAM $3F10-$3F1F.
		Step 301) Render one 8x8 sprite into framebuffer data.
		Step 302) Render all OAM sprites and composite with background.

After Phase 6:
	- Phase 7: pure rendering pipeline plus manual pygame smoke runner
	- Phase 8 / Chapter 06: ROM startup preparation
	- Phase 9 / Chapter 07: controller $4016 behavior
	- Phase 10: manual main.py execution path
	- Phase 11 / Chapter 09: sprite rendering

Controller phase outline:
	Controller state stores 8 buttons in NES read order:
		A, B, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, Right

	CPU write $4016 controls strobe/latch behavior.
	CPU read $4016 returns one button bit at a time.
	Pygame keyboard input should only be connected after the pure controller
	protocol is tested.
---------------------------------------------
Future Notes:

	- Implement PPUSTATUS:
		- Sprite 0 Hit flag behavior:
				- Required:
					background rendering
					sprite rendering
					pixel overlap detection
					PPU timing
		- Sprite Overflow flag behavior:
				- Required:
					OAM memory
					sprite evaluation per scanline
					more than 8 sprites on a scanline
					quirky NES behavior (buggy real hardware behavior)
